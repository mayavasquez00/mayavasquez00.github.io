    <p class="card-text">I entered AUP, or the AMerican University of Paris, through the Trojan Transfer Plan. This means I get to study my first year abroad at Paris, and in my sophmore year I get to start attending the University of Southern California. This school has been such a blessing, as Paris is a beautiful city to not only live in, but is a great start to many different travel destinations.</p>
